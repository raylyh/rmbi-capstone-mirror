### Basic Information
#### logging
>Logging is a means of tracking events that happen when some software runs. The softwareâ€™s developer adds logging calls >to their code to indicate that certain events have occurred. An event is described by a descriptive message which can >optionally contain variable data (i.e. data that is potentially different for each occurrence of the event). Events >also have an importance which the developer ascribes to the event; the importance can also be called the level or >severity.

>Can use logging as **below**:
>>from logger.logger import set_up_logger
>>logger = set_up_logger()
>>logger.info('Message')
>>logger.error('Message')
>>logger.debug('Message')
>>logger.warning('Message')
>>logger.critical('Message')
