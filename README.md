### logger
Logging is a means of tracking events that happen when some software runs. The softwareâ€™s developer adds logging calls to their code to indicate that certain events have occurred. An event is described by a descriptive message which can optionally contain variable data (i.e. data that is potentially different for each occurrence of the event). Events also have an importance which the developer ascribes to the event; the importance can also be called the level or severity.

Can use logging as **below**:
```
from src.logger.logger import set_up_logger

logger = set_up_logger()

logger.info('Message')

logger.error('Message')

logger.debug('Message')

logger.warning('Message')

logger.critical('Message')
```
