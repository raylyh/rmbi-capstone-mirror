# RMBI-Capstone
This project aims to visualize the relationship network of customer clusters in a webpage.
A specific customer can be searched and its ego-network is visualized correspondingly.

Enter the database information in **config.yml** before you run the code.

**Format of config.yml**
```
USER : "your_username"
PASSWORD : "your_password"
PORT : 3306
HOST : "127.0.0.1"
DB : "your_database"
```

## MySQL Database Schema
The database containing the relationship data should have the following tables and their corresponding schema.
```
+----------------------+
| Tables_in_capstone   |
+----------------------+

### logger
Logging is a means of tracking events that happen when some software runs. The softwareâ€™s developer adds logging calls to their code to indicate that certain events have occurred. An event is described by a descriptive message which can optionally contain variable data (i.e. data that is potentially different for each occurrence of the event). Events also have an importance which the developer ascribes to the event; the importance can also be called the level or severity.

Can use logging as **below**:
```
from src.logger.logger import set_up_logger

logger = set_up_logger()

logger.info('Message')

logger.error('Message')

logger.debug('Message')

logger.warning('Message')

logger.critical('Message')
```

For mysql connection:
```
from src.mysql.mysql_in_python import connect_to_mysql
cursor, client = connect_to_mysql(config)
```

For mysql (example) data insert:
```
from src.mysql.mysql_in_python import main
main()
```
